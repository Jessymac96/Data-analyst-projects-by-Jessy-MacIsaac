## Summary of Findings
### Monthly sales trend.
- This line chart has consistent sales growth, except for a sharp decline in sales and a subsequent decrease in profits every January and February.
- Despite overall growth, the drop in these months suggests a post-holiday sales slump, suggesting a need for focused winter marketing strategies to counteract this seasonal decline.

### Top-selling products
- Over the past 3 years, phones and chairs have consistently demonstrated high demand as technological products, while storage, tables, and blinders have followed closely as secondary contenders.
- From 2016 to 2017, phone sales increased by 33% due to technological advancements, new features, and the release of new models.

### Sales by region and state
- Over 3 years, the west and east are leading, followed by the central and southern regions.
- From 2016 to 2017, sales in the West and South regions increased by over 30%, while the East saw an 18% increase. However, the Central region experienced a slight decrease in sales.
