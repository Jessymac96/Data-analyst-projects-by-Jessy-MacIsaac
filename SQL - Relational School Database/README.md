## Tools Used
- Microsoft SQL (Joins and Sub-Querying)
- Data modeling website called Dbdiagram.io 

## Data Source
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bernardnm/great-school 
Imported 4 tables into SQL

### Tables:
### Students
- Includes student ID, name, date of birth, gender, and address.
- Provides a detailed profile of each student within the institution.

### Teachers
- Encompasses teacher ID, names, contact details, and associated subjects.
- Establishes the connection between teachers and the subjects they instruct.

### Subjects
- Consists of subject ID and subject names.
- Simplifies the representation of academic disciplines.

### Marks
- Records academic performance, including marks obtained, exam dates, and associated student, teacher, and subject IDs.
- Facilitates a comprehensive analysis of student achievements across subjects.
